         <h2>Intro</h2>
         <p>My journey into the professional world began with an early affinity for computers; Ive been glued to computers since around age 10.  Initially, I spent a hefty chunk of my day, often 8-15hrs, immersed in front of a computer screen.  Unsurprisingly, this paved my way into a career heavily reliant on computer usage.</p>

         <h2>Current Work</h2>
         <p>While I excel in sales, consistently ranking as top seller both locally and regionally, the customer-facing aspect isn't my cup of tea.  I do find satisfaction in helping others understand concepts though. </p>

         <h2>Inspo</h2>
         <p>Beyond work, Ive long admired art, though my experience lies more in appreciation rather than creating.  Creativity and problem-solving intrigue my passion, making engineering an attractive field.  The logical and abstract nature of the work, coupled with the technology of multi-screen set-ups, "thocky" keyboards, and ergonomic chairs excites me.  </p>

         <h2>Coding Career</h2>
         <p>My ultimate goal as a coder is to master the art of coding, algorithms, and inter-related concepts.  I'd like to surround myself with high-level tinkers and build something of value, that lead to entrepreneurship, passive-income, and early retirement.   </p>
         
         <p>&#129297;The most urgent goal as a coder is to secure a six-figure income.&#129297;</p>
